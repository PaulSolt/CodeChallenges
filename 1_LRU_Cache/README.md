# LRU Cache
2024-05-10

I failed this Code Challenge in two different Technical Interviews at Zillow and Reddit.

* In "1.2 LRU Cache" I reattempted it and failed to finish within 4 hours (probably a easy bug with fresh eyes). 
* In "1.3 LRU Cache" I finished it, but it took me ~4 hours to cleanup the solution and simplify it as much as possible.

Hopefully, you can learn from my notes and my mistakes.

This challenge requires preparation and understanding the "trick".

Try it without looking at my notes, and if you can't finish it within 1 hour, then look at solution code to see what you missed.
